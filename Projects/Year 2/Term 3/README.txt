Hello!

You'll find enclosed:

AdapaProject - Android Application
desktop-dev - Desktop application
Documentation - Our documentation.
ETL - The ETL.
webdev - website.

Our Git is hosted on github via the following URL; https://bitbucket.org/adapa/adapaterm3projectgit

It's currently set to private so let us know if you want to clone etc and we'll sort that out.

The documentation is split into the respective parts for the roles. It was much easier to do this than put it all into one document.
They should be easily found within the documentation folder. If there is anything missing or wrong please get in touch via:

group.adapa@gmail.com 

Or contact David Gregory Our supervisor to get in touch with us.

have a good Christmas!
